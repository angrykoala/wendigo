* Help write Tests or improve Examples / Documentation
* Spread the word :heart:

## Issues

Found a bug, have some feedback or really want some feature? Lock in an Issue. Here are some tips:

* Make sure the bug you're reporting really is a bug. Have you read the docs?
* Provide as many details as you can about the bug. How can it be reproduced? What have you tried so far?
* For feature requests, really explain why your feature is important. How does it improve the library and help the developers using it?
* Go through existing issues. Make sure that it hasn't already been opened.
* If planning on helping close an issue, don't be shy. Ask questions and get more information before sending your PR. Make sure people know you are working on that particular issue.
* Make sure the title of the issue is clear and begins with uppercase

## Pull Requests

Want to fix a bug, implement a feature or help with the tests / docs? Read this first:

* Make sure there's an open issue for what you're sending in your Pull Request. If not, [open it][issues].
* Send in your PRs agains the `dev` branch.
* Write unit tests / docs for any new feature you implement.
* Make sure your PRs pass all tests and CI.
* Be active in your relevant issue and PR threads.
* Make sure no one else is assigned or working on the issue. It's a good idea to leave a comment stating
   that you're going to implement it before sending in your PR. This way no two devs are working on the same
   thing.
